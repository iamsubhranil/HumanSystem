This my take on multithreading by putting up a clone of the human respiratory system.
The HRS basically consists of blood, veins, arteries, lungs and the heart. Two lungs function parallaly, and the heart does it job without caring about other interferences also.
The oxygen that comes from our intake of air by nose gets mixed with the blood corpusles in the lungs, which also frees up the CO2 produced by the cells mixed up in the blood.
As already stated, the cells in turn use oxygen for "cooking" purposes, and blood carries the co2 produced by them back to lungs.
Meanwhile, there's stomach, which handles the base cooking after we eat. The "cooked meal" then gets served to the cells via the blood also.
